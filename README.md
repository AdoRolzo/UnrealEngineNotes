# UnrealEngineNotes
My personal notes accumulating all the knowledge I stumbled upon while working professionally as a Gameplay Programmer in Unreal Engine 4 and 5 . 
Some of it is just helpful links to other knowledge sources. Some of it are my personal notes, shortcuts, workflow tips and other ramblings.
I will be updating it every now and then, with notes that I will retrieve from old paper or cloud notes that I have. So more stuff is coming :D
